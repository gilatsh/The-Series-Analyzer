A simple program in Bash Scripting that displays the series of positive numbers and their statistical properties.
Detailed information about the assignment: 

/There should be a text-based user interface for the program.

/The input of the series (validation) is the first operation.

/It is necessary to have at least three positive numbers.

/There are two possible options:

a.  Using external arguments.

b. There will be no external argument (the user is required to enter a series of numbers).

the menu will be:

a. Enter a series of numbers (Replace the current series).

b. Display the series in the order in which they were entered.

c. Sort the series (from low to high).

d. Display the maximum value of the series.

e. Display the minimum value of the series.

f. Show the average of the series.

g. Provide a display of the number of elements in the series.

h. Display the Sum of the series.

i. Exit.

Once you have selected the correct option in the menu:

/ After input of the menu option, the calculation

should be done.

/ The answer should be displayed.

/ The menu should be displayed once again - until exit option is chosen.

implementation:

/You have to Validate the input (number).

/Implement and use function for each menu option, common tasks in the code Etc.

/Implement as many auxiliary functions as you can (input,input validation, menu Etc. )

/ You need to follow the rules of modular programming (scoping - local/global, function modularity, code

reuse, interfaces between functions - args/returned value Etc.)
