# The-Series-Analyzer// In a class exercise at AWS Re/Start bootcamp, our team was required to complete the following sections:
Build a simple program in Bash Scripting that displays
The statistical properties of a positive number series.
The program should have a textual user interface
The first operation is the input of the series (validation)
At least three positive numbers are required.
Two possibilities exist:
a. Using external arguments, the series was generated
On the command line.
b. If there was no external argument, (or if it was incorrect)
Input) the user will be asked to enter a series of numbers.
Once the series has been set, the program will work with
a menu:
a. Input a Series. (Replace the current series)
b. Display the series in the order it was entered.
c. Display the series in sorted order (from low to
high).
d. Display the Max value of the series.
e. Display the Min value of the series.
f. Display the Average of the series.
g. Display the Number of elements in the series.
h. Display the Sum of the series.
i. Exit.
Once you have selected the correct option in the menu (validate!)
a. After input of the menu option, the calculation
should be done.
b. The answer should be displayed.
c. The menu should be displayed once again - until
Exit option is chosen.
Implementation:
● You have to Validate the input (number).
● Implement and use function for each menu option, common
tasks in the code Etc.
● Implement as many auxiliary functions as you
can.(input,input validation, menu Etc. )
● You need to follow the rules of modular programming
(scoping - local/global, function modularity, code
reuse, interfaces between functions - args/returned
value Etc.)
